# Global E-Commerce Analytics (Olist Dataset)

This project is an end-to-end Data Analytics pipeline using SQL, Python, and Power BI on the Olist E-Commerce dataset.  
As a data analyst for a global e-commerce platform, my goal is to understand revenue, customer behavior, product performance, and delivery efficiency to help leadership decide where to invest marketing budget, operations, and logistics.
